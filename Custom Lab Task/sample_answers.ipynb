    "\n",
    "Forensic analysis in the context of cybersecurity refers to the investigation and examination of digital evidence to understand how an incident occurred, identify malicious activity, and determine its impact. When applied to process information on a device, forensic analysis involves reviewing data about running and previously executed processesâ€”such as their names, execution paths, user accounts, start times, parent-child relationships, and resource usage.\n",

    "In this task we will be looking at the system information of a device and labelling different processes are either malicious or non-malicious. In this file there is a CSV `process_data.csv` and we would like to analyse any potential suspicious processes that could of existed on this device.\n"

    "High CPU (CPU% > 80)\n",
    "Malicious processes, especially those involved in data exfiltration or cryptomining, often consume a large portion of system resources like CPU. A sudden spike in CPU usage could be a sign that a process is running hidden tasks, such as running complex computations (e.g., cryptocurrency mining) or scanning the system for sensitive information. Legitimate applications rarely utilize over 80% of the CPU unless performing resource-heavy tasks.\n",

    "Certain process names are commonly associated with known malicious software or attack tools. For example, processes like mimikatz.exe or trojan.exe are often used in attacks related to credential theft, privilege escalation, or remote access. If a process name matches any of these suspicious or known malware-associated names, it could be a sign of malicious activity on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Network Connections (NetworkConnections > 50)\n",
    "A high number of network connections could indicate that a process is attempting to communicate with many external servers or other machines, possibly for command-and-control (C&C) activities or exfiltrating data. Malicious software, such as botnets, ransomware, or worms, often tries to establish multiple outbound connections to a variety of IP addresses to spread or receive commands. This behavior is typically abnormal for a legitimate process, especially in terms of the sheer number of connections it opens."

    "\n",
    "The model's performance is acceptable, but not yet optimal. It detected malicious processes based on known indicators such as high CPU usage and unusual network connections. However, it struggled with more nuanced cases, particularly those where the process name didn't match predefined suspicious names. The overall performance, while somewhat effective, highlights the need for more sophisticated analysis and additional context-specific features to refine its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the accuracy, I would first incorporate additional data points such as the process's execution time, parent-child relationships, and historical behavior of the process. This would allow the model to identify anomalies that are not immediately apparent from the features used. I would also experiment with machine learning algorithms to allow the model to learn from patterns in the data rather than relying on hardcoded rules. Additionally, integrating more comprehensive datasets with labeled malicious activity could provide more diverse examples to train the model, improving its ability to generalize.\n"
