## Information:

This is a custom lab task created by me which is similar to the IDS labs but instead of analysing network traffic we analyse process information on a host device

The host device information was generated using the `data_script.py` file. So this data isn't totally accurate and is generated with a range of values for malicious and normal processes.

`analyse.ipynb` is the file in which the students can fill out and there is a sample answers version of the lab in `sample_answers.ipynb`.
